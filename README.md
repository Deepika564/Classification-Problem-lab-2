This project focuses on customer segmentation using supervised machine learning algorithms to classify customer graduation statusâ€”a proxy for socio-economic profiling. Using a structured dataset of 2,627 customer records with demographic and behavioral attributes (such as Age, Gender, Spending Score, Work Experience), we apply three classification models: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Trees. Our primary goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting whether a customer is likely to graduate, which informs marketing strategies for targeted engagement.

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before model training. Missing values in "Work Experience" and "Family Size" were handled using listwise deletion and mean imputation, respectively. One-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables like Gender. Standardization was used for k-NN to ensure feature scaling compatibility. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided insight into data structure, revealing an average customer age of 43.6 years and highlighting skewed distributions in experience and graduation status (72% of customers had graduated).

We evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression outperformed the others with a 70.1% accuracy and 89% recall, making it the most reliable classifier for predicting graduation status. The k-NN model followed with a 68.2% accuracy and decent performance across other metrics, though it was highly sensitive to feature scaling. Decision Trees were the least effective, with overfitting problems and the lowest generalization ability (63.2% accuracy).

From a business perspective, this project demonstrates how demographic and behavioral data can be leveraged to create actionable customer segments. Age and Work Experience were the most influential predictors, whereas Gender had minimal predictive power. The models provide a foundation for strategic customer targeting and reveal that logistic regression offers both interpretability and robustness in real-world, imperfect datasets.

Future work could explore more complex segmentation methods such as k-means clustering, neural networks, or hybrid models to discover deeper patterns. This project also opens avenues to improve predictive performance by enhancing feature engineering or incorporating unstructured data. Ultimately, this machine learning framework contributes to data-driven decision-making and personalized marketing strategies in customer relationship management.# Classification-Problem-lab-2
